# Bikesharing

#Overview of the statistical analysis:
This module focuses on helping an individual analyze the bike sharing company within Des moines. I will use the csv file data provided for new york city bike data
and I will conduct analysis with this given data set using the ETL process. Then after the data has been cleaned and transformed I will upload the data to 
Tableau and create useful visulizations to help understand the data much better. 



The purpose of the analysis is well defined. (5 pt)
There are at least seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis (7 pt)
There is a description of the results for each visualization (7 pt)

#Results:

The following visulizations will describe and show the following: 
Visulizations are in the attached folder please refer to all 7. 

How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.









#Summary:
Overall in I was able to perform an Analysis on NYC Citi Bike and Scale this analysis to perform feasibility on Cityâ€”Des Moines. I was able to see that it may not be on that scale of nyc, it will have rider subcribers in des moines overall and should be successful at a smaller scale.
